                                My name is Steven Hy and my ethnicity is Chinese. Despite being Chinese I grew up surrounded by Vietnamese culture as both my parents are Chinese but lived and grew up in Vietnam. At home I speak Cantonese and can neither understand Chinese or Vietnamese. Currently I am both studying and aiming to complete a degree in the Bachelor of IT which I hope can assist me in getting a job. Outside of work and university I like to spend my leisure time playing games such as valorant or any new upcoming titles that interest me. Apart from playing video games I enjoy organising time to spend with my mates, whether that be a small get together or a big event somewhere close by.

                <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
                <h3>What is my interest in IT?</h3>
			    <p>My interest in IT began during my studies in a completely different course that had no links to IT it was a degree in urban and regional planning. During this course I came to the realisation that this course isn't the path I want to take and so I took a more serious thought into what type of career I would want in my future. Among the many careers out there, jobs in the field of IT stood out to me. IT is such a versatile and growing field that it intrigued me to dig deeper into the type of work that is done in which it sparked an interest in me as I saw what programmers and developers do and the amount of critical thinking that they go through to solve problems that arise during their work. This in turn sparked a massive interest in me to become just like them because of the type of work they do, to me it keeps them challenged and rewarded which is something that appeals to me.</p>
                <h3>Why did I choose to go to RMIT?</h3>
			    <p>The choice to come to RMIT was surprisingly easy to make for multiple reasons. The location it was situated in, was the most convenient and less time consuming option to attend as well as being right in the center of the city which made it extremely more appealing to attend knowing there are many shops and restaurants which are within my reach. Another reason as to why I attended RMIT was because many of my friends and family came here and they too have a positive reaction attending RMIT which gave me confidence knowing RMIT was a safe choice to make.</p>
                <h3>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h3>
			    <p>During my stay at RMIT I naturally expect to learn the skills required to obtain a degree in IT but to also learn how to work in a professional environment, to learn how to communicate with my peers and future coworkers and learn how to work in teams and groups as efficiently as possible. These expectations that I set from myself to RMIT is because I know RMIT understands that there is more to your degree than just being able to accomplish assignments and hand them in on time as communication and professionalism is just as important when it comes to my future career.</p>

            <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
            <p>The results of these tests only strengthen what I believe about myself in terms of personality and work as the results demonstrate I am more of a listening type and that I only speak where needed or when required to do so, but I always keep my eyes and ears open and ready to jump right into the discussion or work.

            <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
            <p>
            In a team environment these results will display me to be the quiet type until we get working on assignments, although the Myers-Briggs test shows that I am into social engagement which is true, the other two tests demonstrate that I am the listening and less extroverted type. These results show I like to listen rather than speak to absorb information, while the Myers-Briggs test shows that despite being quieter during discussions I am able to pull my weight where needed during team assignments and jump into discussions where necessary.

            </p>

                <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
            <p>
            When forming a team, it should be taken into account to make sure there is a member that isn’t afraid to speak out their ideas and solutions to any work or problems that may arise to allow a discussion to unfold to allow me to demonstrate to the best of my abilities.

                <div class="project-idea">
                    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The project will be a smartphone software that is used to track the price of items that are currently being sold and bought around the world. It is an app that will mainly be used to help secondhand sellers price their item by displaying the retail price of the item it currently is at and display information regarding the item, including a tracker of cost over the years or recent prices it has been sold at. The main target audience or secondhand merchants.
            </p>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>Sites like Ebay and facebook marketplace are commonly used to sell secondhand items yet they lack a means to help assist sellers in marketing the value of their items efficiently. Sellers on these sites have to research the cost and value of their item before creating a listing which is immensely inefficient. Those that spend a big chunk of their time researching what they are planning to sell and make a majority of their income from working by selling in these types of marketplaces will find my app to be extremely useful as they will have a detailed organised set of information along with a pricing guide to assist them.
            </p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This smartphone software is intended to support merchants on websites such as Facebook Marketplace, Ebay and gumtree and other similar platforms. The software is designed to be simple and responsive and is intended to run codes that are able to obtain data from databases which contain the necessary statistics which is then organised and structured out to display information about a massive range of items that have been sold on platforms that offer the ability to sell second hand items.<br>

            Price Tag Feature<br>
                The main feature of this software will be a price tag displayed on every item possible as well as an extended feature to take an in-depth look into all types of prices that it has been sold at and the ability to categorically display the data in forms such as highest price, or recent price. The price itself will have its own set of information that will display the date it was sold, the platform that it was sold at and the condition of the item at the time of trade. There will be a display of its current retail price, if it is still circulating in a market, and a visual representation of the avg price of the item over the years by providing a chart to read.<br>
            Additional Information Feature<br>
                Along with the main feature the app will provide support features that enhance the experience of the app for users. With the main focus being information intended for second hand merchants this feature will present information that will help the user obtain information about what the item is about such as what its features are, what the purpose of it is and anything that can help the user create a listing efficiently. There will be an organised section that the user can read through that allows the user to learn more about their item that they are looking to sell. The organised information will have information such as a  description tab that provides a small worded description that the original manufacturer listed, a model tab to compare to other models before it or even maybe a current market tab that shows where it is currently being sold etc.<br>
            Responsive and Simple Search<br>
                By including a responsive and easy to use search method, users of the software will be able to quickly and more efficiently get to where they want whilst using the software. The search method will first allow them to search up the name of their item, or in the scenario that they do not know what their item name is they will be able to search up keywords such as a description of what their item is aka “charger” or even to type in a serial code that will potentially present the item to them. This search bar will contain the ability to filter out undesired or even desired aspects of the item the user is looking to search.
            </p>
            <h3>Tool and Techonolgies</h3>
            <p>To begin designing the software an integrated development environment is necessary to start this project, along with a computer/laptop and mobile phone that is running on preferably android in order to run and test programs. To create the software it is also extremely helpful but not necessary, to have a database on specific item prices, descriptions of items or even access to ebay or facebooks marketplace APIs as it will provide analytics that may be of some use to building the software.</p>
            <h3>Skills Required</h3>
            <p>In terms of software and hardware, they are easy to get yours hands on as everyone is expected to have both a laptop/computer and phone in this day and age. As for the skills required to design a project like this it will require a vast experience that I currently do not have.
            The developer of this software will be required to be proficient in a suitable coding language as well have the mathematical aptitude and problem solving skills.
            Not only are skills not as feasible, the option to use a database or APIs that are able to provide the data required to make this program successful will be difficult to obtain or create.
            </p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>If this project is successful, there may potentially be a big spike in the use of consumer-to-consumer selling platforms, this will impact the business of such platforms to have an influx of both merchants and items being sold on their platform. The original problem of second hand merchants inefficiently listing items, and wasting a lot of time to find a suitable price will not impact them as they will have the information ready within the minute. It is expected that merchants that sell second hand items as a source of income will be able to sell more if they spend less time organising the listing, and more time obtaining items that they can resell.</p>
